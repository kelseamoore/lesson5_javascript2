### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. There are three primitive JavaScript data types: number, string and Boolean. Number data types represent numerical data, string data types includes characters and Boolean data represents true or false values.
2. JavaScript functions are used to perform an action on a webpage. Functions can be used to handle events such as calculating a total, retreiving a date or adding information to a form.
3. Control statements allow you to control how information in an application is processed. An example of control statements are while and do/while statements. While similar, it is important to note the difference between while and do/while statements. While statements test the conditon at the beginning and loop through the conditions to find one that is true. Do/while statements will always execute the first statement and then loop through the rest of the conditions to see if one is true.
